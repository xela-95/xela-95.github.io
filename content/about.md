I'm a Robotics Software Engineer, currently working at the [**Artificial and Mechanical Intelligence Lab**](https://ami.iit.it/it/) at the **Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)**.

Here, I have the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies to enhance the capabilities of humanoid robots.

In particular, my work focuses on the **simulation and control of humanoid robots** and some of my contributions include:

- Working on a Research Project on humanoid robotics sponsored by [**Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc.**](https://sonyinteractive.com/en/), aka the company behind PlayStation (Simulink, Matlab);
- I’m part of the [iRonCub]([url](https://ami.iit.it/it/aerial-humanoid-robotics)) project, a pioneering project that aims to give humanoid robots the ability to fly. I’m responsible for developing and implementing base estimation algorithms, ensuring accurate state estimation for stable flight and locomotion.
- Contributing to the development of [**JaxSim**](https://github.com/ami-iit/jaxsim), a next-generation open-source simulator built in **Python** and **JAX** for differentiable robotic simulations;
- Developing open-source [**C++ libraries**](https://github.com/robotology/gz-sim-yarp-plugins) to seamlessly integrate the robotics stack with the **Gazebo-Sim simulator**, using **Yarp middleware** for real-time communication and simulation.
Before IIT, I worked as an **ML Engineer** at Tenova, completing a graduate program within the **Techint** group. My experience there involved applying Industry 4.0 technologies to improve industrial processes through data-driven solutions.

I hold a **B.Sc.** (2017) and an **M.Sc.** (2020, with highest honors) in **Automation and Control Engineering** from [**Politecnico di Milano**](https://www.polimi.it/), where I developed my master’s thesis under the supervision of Professor Paolo Rocco at the [Merlin Robotics Lab](http://merlin.deib.polimi.it/).

In my free time, I enjoy spending time in nature, running, trail running, cycling, and playing soccer. I’m also passionate about video games, movies, and books.
